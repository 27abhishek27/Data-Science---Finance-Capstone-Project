# 📈 Finance Data Analysis Capstone Project  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project analyzes stock data for major U.S. banks to uncover trends, correlations, and financial patterns. We use **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly** to visualize stock prices, returns, and risk factors over time.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes stock price data for six major banks:  
- **Bank of America (BAC)**  
- **Citigroup (C)**  
- **Goldman Sachs (GS)**  
- **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)**  
- **Morgan Stanley (MS)**  
- **Wells Fargo (WFC)**  

## 💡 Key Insights  
✔ **Banks with high correlation** tend to move together, meaning their stock performance is linked.  
✔ **Moving averages** help predict market trends and provide valuable insights for traders.  
✔ **Stock volatility analysis** reveals which banks carry higher investment risks.  
✔ **Seasonal trends** affect banking stock prices, influenced by economic events, policies, and interest rates.
